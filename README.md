# Hi there, I'm **Feeeeddmmmeee** ðŸ‘‹
I like to code but I don't usually do anything advanced. I'm a student from Poland who likes programming, maths and chemistry.
I'm currently working on my [Minecraft Fabric mod](https://github.com/Feeeeddmmmeee/MinecraftEssentials) in Java, my [Discord Bot](https://github.com/JustDonutTeam/DonutBot) and my Python [API wrapper](https://github.com/Feeeeddmmmeee/intersection.py).
